# Getting and Cleaning Data
Getting and Cleaning Data, week 4 submission

This repository contains my submission for the week 4 assignment.

The R script, 'run_analysis.R, does the following :
1. Download the file and put the file in the working folder
2. Unzip the file
3. Read data from the files into the variables
4. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
8. Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The result is shown in the file 'tidy.txt'.
